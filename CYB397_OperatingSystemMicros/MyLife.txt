I was born in Edina, Minnesota in 1990.  I spent the first eleven years 
of my life living in Richfield, Minnesota, which is a suburb of Minneapolis.
At age twelve, I moved to Big Lake, Minnesota, which is about 25 miles
south of St. Cloud, and is where I would reside until college started.  
My interests include fishing, hockey, and anything involving technology.
My stay at St. Cloud State University began in Sherburne Hall, which is where
I lived freshman year in the dormitories.  The fact that Sherburne is
connected to the Garvey Cafeteria made it a very livable environment.
I enjoyed the dorms, but have moved off campus into an apartment to live
a more individual lifestyle. 
My dreams after I leave St. Cloud State University involve leaving the
state of Minnesota.  I have lived my whole life in Minnesota, and I love the
state, but I think it's personally time for a change.  I would like to find
a job out in California, possibly in San Jose, or at least near the Silicon
Valley.
